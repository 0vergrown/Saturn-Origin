# ü™ê Saturn Origin ü™ê

**This Pack Adds:**
- Custom Origin
- Custom Dimension

**Origin Detail:**

**Icon**: Structure Void\
**Impact**: üî¥üî¥üî¥\
**Description**: A deity born with both the limitless and six eyes, his overwhelming power forming a god complex and suffers because of it.

*Positive* üü¢:
- **Black Flash**: A distortion in space that occurs when cursed energy is applied with 0.000001 seconds of a physical hit. Causing the caster to dash instantly to the target dealing damage while sending them into the air from which can be followed up by a second hit, dashing the caster up to the target in the air dealing additional damage, and can be turned into a full combo if the caster lands the final hit while in the air, the target gets smashed down into the ground taking additional damage. Landing the full combo reduces the cool down period by 75%. (Primary)
- **Cursed Technique**: Lapse Blue. The strengthened Limitless increases cursed energy to bring the concepts of "negative numbers" and "negative distance" into reality. Doing so forces the area to fill in the negative space by drawing everything toward the impossibility, generating a force of attraction, similar to a black hole. (Load Toolbar Activator)
    - Pulls entities within a 15 block radius into the casted area, dealing 2.5 hearts per 2 seconds for a total of 8 seconds.
- **Unlimited Void**: The Unlimited Void presents the target with limitless information, forcing them to see and feel everything while seeing and feeling nothing at the exact same time. This phenomenon paralyzes the target with infinite knowledge, causing them to die slowly. This domain heightens your abilities while active, after 30 seconds the target will be sent out of the domain however the caster can stay and leave as they please. (Save Toolbar Activator)
    - Slowness X, Blindness X, and Wither I to target for 15 seconds, Caster gains Strength I while in Unlimited Void.
- **Gravity Manipulation**: The user manipulates/distort/warp space and can fluctuate gravity and create force zones using it. Allowing them to float, using positive energy and combing it with limitless you can boost yourself forward and fly properly. (Secondary)
    - Toggleable with (Secondary) key. To ascend, simply press or hold the (Jump) key; to descend, hold (Sneak). Pressing your (Sprint) key will toggle your flight mode. While in flight mode, use the (Jump) again to boost your speed, soaring effortlessly through the air.

*Negative* üî¥:
- **God Complex**: Your overwhelming power created a god complex within you. You see others as lesser beings and often underestimate threats.
    - 1.3 times more damage from all sources.
- **Shell Shock**: Due to your ability to use powerful cursed techniques and manipulate matter at will, you aren't used to anyone being able to hurt you, making you sometimes panic when it happens.
    - 30% chance of getting Slowness X and Blindness X for three seconds on hit.
- **Psychotic Break**: Losing half or more of your health messes with your God Complex and you begin doubting your abilities.
    - Slower and Weaker
- **Frail**: Despite your unique abilities, you're not very physically adept. Certain armor sets are too heavy for you.
    - Protections higher than chainmail. Also because of this you have eight hearts instead of 10
